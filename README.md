# Pure JS SPA Poc

Available at https://nelsonserpa.com

I pursued learning how complex tasks are handled underneath by using as little frameworks as possible. As a tradeoff, there's much to improve in performance and security.

The frontend runs a SPA in pure HTML/CSS/Js through Stateful MVC Components. Routes are handled through history api. Backend runs in Node.

The deploy was manually configured in a VPS using Nginx as a reverse proxy, which is fully documented in the [my blog](https://nelsonserpa.com/blog/infra_devops/1)

The project is still under construction.
