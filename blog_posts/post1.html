<h2 id="what-is-web-scraping">What is web scraping?</h2>
<p>Web scraping is programatically extracting data from websites into structured data formats, such as JSON, CSV and others. </p>
<p>Extracting raw data may not be trivial. Apart from the inherent complexity of how the website displays data (some more or less simple), sometimes it is provided in complex formats to process such as images or PDFs. Furthermore, just extracting data once does not attend most projects requirements. Further steps such as transforming the data in a convenient way and loading it into a database (Also kown as ETL: Extract, Transform, Load) is recurrently done when Web Scraping. Schedueling the scraping script so it runs periodically and deploying it so it can run on the cloud are also common tasks. </p>
<p>Therefore, web scraping is an intersectional field that often involves data mining, data engineering and devops tasks.</p>
